/**
 * What a pedestrian who has just been hit by a car is doing.
 *
 * DIVERGENCE, deliberate and whole-cloth: the original has no vehicle-vs-person collision of any
 * kind. `FUN_0049ee30`/`FUN_0049be50` only ever queue a car behind another car, and the person move
 * core (`FUN_004c9000`) searches for *people*, so a pedestrian and a car simply pass through one
 * another. Nothing below is ported from anything, and there is no `FUN_004xxxxx` to cite for it.
 *
 * The rule the remake adds instead: the car does not brake, does not swerve and loses no speed. The
 * person takes the whole exchange, launched proportionally to how fast the car was going and then
 * exaggerated well past what the momentum would really do - the goofy 1996-cartoon reading, not a
 * physics one. They tumble as one rigid body (a privanim figure is line segments with no skeleton,
 * so there is nothing to articulate), bounce off the ground, the buildings and into the water, and
 * once still they get up and walk away. Nobody is hurt and no mission is raised.

	 * ten ticks at movespeed 10 - about half a metre - and the steady-state loop after it is
	 * Idle-10 / 'idle a bit' / probe, with no walk in it at all. In the original that is the whole
