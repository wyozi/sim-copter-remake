/**
 * The one place anything in the remake asks "is it night?".
 *
 * The original answered that with a single global, `DAT_004f9720`, set from the city's `career.twk`
 * Day/Night column and toggled by the 0x37 debug key in `FUN_004796c0`. **One is night** - proved
 * three ways: `FUN_0049a8b0` hands the renderer a dimmer ambient/diffuse for it (0x1999/0x3333/
 * 0x1999/0x4ccc against the day's 0x1999/0x6666/0x4ccc/0xcccc, 16.16), `FUN_0047a240` calls
 * `FUN_004a03a0(1)` + `FUN_004834f0` to SHOW the face-type-11 light cards (car headlights and the
 * LAMP35..38 street-lamp glows) for it, and `FUN_004606d0` loads `skydark.bmp` instead of `sky.bmp`.
 * That last one also closes the "which value is night" follow-up in Docs/MissionsAndTweakSystem.md.
 *
 * The remake has a continuously moving sun instead of a boolean, so the same answer comes out as an
 * alpha across the sunset and sunrise fades; callers that genuinely need the boolean take
 * `IsNight()`.

// across 400 cm quads, so any contour thresholded out of it traces the grid: straight along tile

// space before the ramp displaces that contour laterally - by roughly strength / |grad(weight)| -
// which turns the stair-step into a line that wanders over the tile boundaries instead of along
// them.
//
// Strength is in weight units, so how far the contour actually moves depends on how fast the weight
// ramps on a given coast; a shallow shore wanders more than a steep one. The scale is a wavelength
// in centimetres.
//
// THESE ARE TUNED ON SCREEN AND THEY ARE NOT WHAT THE THEORY PREDICTED. The reasoning above says
// the wavelength has to exceed the 400 cm tile so the contour WANDERS further than the stair-step
// it is hiding, and the first defaults (900 / 300 cm) were picked that way. What actually looks
// right is 25 cm and 4 cm at roughly ten times the strength - far below a tile, which dissolves the
// boundary into a stochastic band instead of moving it. Both hide the grid; the fine one hides it

// layer.
//
// **Interpolated with a Catmull-Rom through four frames, and NOT with a smoothstep between two.**
// The smoothstep version read as visibly framey, and the reason is what it is for: ease-in-ease-out
// gives the field zero velocity at every keyframe, so it arrives, holds, and rushes to the next -
// still, fast, still, fast, once per frame. Going higher-order (smootherstep) flattens the ends
// further and makes the hold longer, so the obvious next step makes it worse. A cubic through four
// control points takes its slope at each frame from that frame's neighbours and therefore passes
// through without stopping, which is the ordinary keyframe-interpolation answer to the ordinary
// keyframe-interpolation problem. It costs four spatial taps per layer instead of two.
//
// Layer 2 is the fine one (4 cm), so its rate is where shimmer would come from if it is pushed:

// sparkles. If the water fizzes when seen from high up, this is the number to bring down.
