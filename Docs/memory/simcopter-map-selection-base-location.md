# SimCopter map selection, Base Location and the transport record

*Decoded 2026-09-23 from the Ghidra exports (`.ghidra-exports/*.json`) and ported the same day.*

What the cockpit map points at, who decides, and what a transport record holds. The original
answers all three in the mission layer, not in the map.

## The Base Location record (mask 0x100000)

- City entry `FUN_0047a240` resets the table (`FUN_004a6c80`, which also sets `DAT_0057f9d8 = 0`).
  Its last call is `FUN_004a7a10(DAT_005d91d0, DAT_005d91d4, 0x100000)`.
- `DAT_005d91d0/d4` = airport origin (`_DAT_005d91b0/b4`) **+ 1**, written by `FUN_004829f0`.
- The 0x100000 branch of `FUN_004a7a10` does `sprintf(rec, "%s", DAT_005816b8)`. It then sets
  `+0x20 = 0`, `+0x24 = -1` (no event id), category 0, and leaves `+0x30`/`+0x38` at -1.
- Mask 0x100000's type/voice id is **0x24a = string 586 "Base Location"**. 0x23b..0x24b map to
  strings 571..587; 0x24b is "Non-Mission Event". The remake used to call this bit **"UFO". That
  was wrong**: the flying UFO is ambient plane slot 1 and is paid through `EVT_UfoResolved`.
- The shared tail of `FUN_004a7a10` adopts the new record as the selection when none exists, so it
  is slot 0 and selected. The same tail also:
  - counts it in `DAT_0057f9c8` (active jobs). The scheduler cap Max Easy + tier therefore always
    has one slot taken. **The remake's scheduler leaves it out (deliberate divergence, 2026-09-23,
    `UpdateSchedulerCadence`)**: at tier 1 (career cities 0-8 and 10, cap 3) the faithful count
    meant one job at a time and a full 380 s Easy Interval wait for a second, because the IntervalAdj
    speed-up is zero with only one slot free. That played as long idle stretches. Logged as
    divergence 3 in [[simcopter-pacing-divergences]].
  - posts the kind-5 message 0x24a.
  - sets `DAT_00505fb4 = DAT_00505fac`.
- `FUN_004a73e0` wraps everything in `if ((rec[0x50] & 0x100000) == 0)`. The record only ages; it
  never completes, expires, scores or gets adopted by the lifecycle.
- `FUN_004a4000(0x100000)` = -1/-1: no map icon. It is visible only when selected, as line A to the
  base.
- `FUN_004a92f0` and `FUN_004ab480` have no 0x100000 case.
- `.data` initial values (read from the exe; `.data` raw offset 0xfdc00 for VA 0x500000) are all
  zero for `DAT_00505fac`, `fa4`, `fb4`, `f0c`, `f10` and `f08`. The tweak loader and
  `FUN_004a6c80` set them.

## DAT_0057f9d8 - the map's selected record (a record pointer)

Every write, exhaustively (xrefs to 0x0057f9d8):

| Where | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `FUN_004a6c80` (city reset) | = 0 |
| `FUN_004a7a10` / `FUN_004a9a10` tail | if null and new record's category != 2: = new |
| `FUN_004a73e0` live arm (cat not 2/4/8, not 0x100000) | if null: = this record |
| `FUN_004a73e0` completion (cat 8, all goals met, cat-2 jam `cleared == count`) | if it was the selected record: = 0, then the first slot with bit0 set and +0x54 != 2 |
| `FUN_004a73e0` cat-4 arm and jam 0x5a0000 expiry | **no write**: a failed/expired selected record STAYS selected (stale) |
| `FUN_004a9860` / `FUN_004a9900` (commands 0x1e / 0x1d in `FUN_004796c0`; map buttons via thunks `4a3ed0`/`4a3ec0`) | next/prev live non-cat-2 slot, wrapping; no change if null or nothing else |
| `FUN_004ab3e0` (load) | = first live non-cat-2 slot |

- The event sink `FUN_004a89c0` / `FUN_004aa150` never writes it, so a **pickup, a delivery or a
  timeout does not change the selection**.
- The getters `FUN_004a8960`/`8940`/`8990` test only the pointer and the -1 coords, not the active
  bit. The map therefore keeps drawing a stale record until the player cycles or a new record
  reuses the slot.
- Failure paths that post `EVT_SetCategory` 4: `FUN_004b2cd0` (plane whose fire became its own
  mission) and `FUN_004b8b60` (failed criminal-car arrest).
- There is no generic mission-timeout expiry in `FUN_004a73e0`. See
  [passenger failure](simcopter-passenger-mission-failure.md).

## What the map draws

- **`FUN_004a3820`, the selected record.**
  - Line A (shade `0x3f - 16*len/0x184`) goes to `+0x30`, else `+0x28`.
  - Line B (`0x6a - 8*len/0x184`) goes to `+0x38` when it is set.
  - **No icons** (icon -1), and no "begun" swap.
  - With nothing selected it draws only the heading needle.
- **`FUN_004a4200`, the other records.** It covers every live, non-cat-2, non-selected record.
  - Icons from `FUN_004a4000(exact mask)`: the first at (`+0x30`, else `+0x28`), the second at
    `+0x38`.
  - They are drawn along an invisible ray, so an off-screen record is pinned to the edge.
  - They are gated by `DAT_00505f0c` (the marker toggle) inside `FUN_004a3f20`.
- **0x40 = (-1, 3).** A transport shows no icon at its drop-off and icon 3 at its pickup only. Once
  picked up, an unselected transport shows **nothing**.
- The label (`FUN_004547a0`) prints the selected record's name and is blank when nothing is
  selected. At city start it reads "Base Location".

## The transport record (0x40, `FUN_004a7a10`)

- `+0x28` = the placer's tile, a mission building = the **destination**.
- `+0x30` = copy of `+0x28` = the drop-off. `FUN_004a88e0` hands it to BHAV 292.
- `+0x38` = the **pickup**. `FUN_004a7a10` draws up to 10 times with `FUN_004abb30(+0x28)`; the
  first draw on XBLD 0x70..0xdb wins, and 10 misses fail the creation. The party
  (`rand % (tier+1) + 1`) spawns here, and `FUN_004ab480` announces here.
- `FUN_004a73e0` clears `+0x38` when `pickedUp(+0xa4) + dead(+0xb4) + lost(+0xbc) == passengers(+0x88)`.
  It completes the record on `delivered(+0x9c) + dead + lost == passengers`.
- **Medevac (0x20) leaves `+0x30` at -1** and puts the patient at `+0x28`, which is cleared on
  pickup. Since 2026-09-23 the remake does the same: any hospital takes the patient (see
  [paramedic handoffs](simcopter-paramedic-handoffs.md)). The map panel no longer needs to hide an
  invented hospital.

## The four player-reported claims (verdicts)

1. **"Base Location mode by default: a line to the base, icons for live jobs."** CONFIRMED. The mode
   is simply the Base Location record being selected.
2. **"Transport shows only the pickup until pickup, then the drop-off."** CONTRADICTED.
   - Unselected: icon at the pickup only, then nothing.
   - Selected: lines to both from the start, then the drop-off line only.
3. **"The map switches to the transport on pickup and back to base when it finishes."**
   - Switching on pickup: CONTRADICTED.
   - Back to base on finish: CONFIRMED, but only when the finished record was the selected one. The
     completion re-pick lands on slot 0, which is Base Location.
4. **"The map switches away on timeout/failure."** CONTRADICTED. Category 4 and jam expiry leave
   the selection stale.

## Remake port (2026-09-23)

- `FSimCopterMissionSystem` owns `DAT_0057f9d8` as `FocusRecordIndex`. All writes go through
  `SetMapFocusRecordIndex(slot, EMapFocusReason)`, the **hook for remake-only selection rules**.
- `EnsureBaseLocationRecord` is called from actor `BeginSession` and every tick. Every tick covers a
  late airport and old saves.
- **Deliberately not ported:** the base record's kind-5 message (no "Base Location started" in the
  ticker or career log) and its countdown reset.
- The transport layout matches the original. Saves in the old layout (`+0x28` = pickup,
  `+0x30` = destination) are migrated on load.
- The mission catalog's "UFO" row is removed, because it only created a second base record.
- Tests: `SimCopter.Missions.BaseLocationRecord`, `.MapFocusRules`,
  `.SaveFocusAndTransportLayout`, `.MarkerCoordinates`, and `SimCopter.Map.Overlays`.

## Remake-only rules layered on top (2026-09-23)

Chosen by the project owner over strict fidelity; both go through `SetMapFocusRecordIndex` with
their own `EMapFocusReason`, so they are easy to find or drop:

- **`PassengersAboard`** — `EVT_VictimPickedUp` on a transport (0x40) selects that record, so the
  map follows the job the player is now flying to its drop-off. The original never writes
  DAT_0057f9d8 on the pickup path.
- **`Expired`** — `RefocusAfterExpiry` runs on the category-4 and jam-expiry arms and re-picks the
  first live record (Base Location) when the dead record was the selection. The original leaves
  that stale selection on the map until the player cycles.

`SimCopter.Missions.MapFocusRules` asserts the remake behaviour for both.
