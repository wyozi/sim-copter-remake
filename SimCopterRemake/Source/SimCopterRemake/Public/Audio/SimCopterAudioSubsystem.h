//
// The original owns exactly one DirectSound buffer per registered id (the array at 0x0055b1ac)
// and every gameplay system talks to it through nine free functions that index by id:
//
//   FUN_0042a2a0(id, flags)          Play2D          volume = master, no attenuation
//   FUN_0042a1f0(id, pos, flags)     Play3D          culled past 1920 units, then SetPosition
//   FUN_0042a310(id)                 Stop
//   FUN_0042a3a0(id)                 IsPlaying
//   FUN_0042a360(id, adj)            SetVolumeAdjust
//   FUN_0042a2f0(id, pos)            SetPosition     -> FUN_004247c0, the attenuation law
//   FUN_0042a330(id, delta)          AddFrequency    SetFreq(base + delta), NOT cumulative
//   FUN_0042a100(id, name)           SetFile         swap the WAV in a slot
//   FUN_0042a3b0(_, id, _)           queued play with a completion list
//
// Each sound id remains a single playback slot: repeated play requests do not duplicate it.
// Short people voices play independently of the loop bank, with one active play per event,
// so different speech and effects can coexist without replacing an EKG or another line.
//
