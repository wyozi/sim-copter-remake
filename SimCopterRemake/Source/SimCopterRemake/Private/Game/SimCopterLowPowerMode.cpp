	// This table used to force `r.AntiAliasingMethod 1` (FXAA). It does not any more, and the
	// Anti-Aliasing row stays live in this mode. The mode renders at 75% screen percentage, and TSR
	// is the only method in the list that *upscales* - FXAA at 75% is a spatial stretch of a blurry
	// image, which is the worst-looking thing the mode did. TSR is also not left at its full price:
	// scalability's `AntiAliasingQuality@0` (which the mode already applies, and which is not a
	// method switch) takes the history to 100% screen percentage rather than 200%, R11G11B10,
	// UpdateQuality 0, and drops flickering rejection, the reprojection field and resurrection.
	//
	// A player who wants it gone still has None in the dropdown, which is the honest way to spend
	// that part of the frame elsewhere. Nothing here stands down for DLSS either - `ApplyGraphics`
	// already skips writing the method while super resolution is on, because DLSS owns it.

	// --- global illumination and reflections ---------------------------------------------------
	//
	// Scalability@0 sets `r.Lumen.DiffuseIndirect.Allow 0`, which stops Lumen LIGHTING but leaves the
	// GI method as Lumen, so the scene still maintains a Lumen scene and its surface cache. Dropping
	// the method itself is what actually stops that work. Reflections go to None rather than

	// show flag), which is why nothing here bothers with per-component cast flags. The virtual shadow

	// motion blur, DOF, AO and the light shafts are off. 1 is the cheapest gaussian sum that still
	// glows - and something has to, because the night windows, the fire and the effect cards are all
